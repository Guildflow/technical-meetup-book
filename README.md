# Creating and Running a Successful Technical Meetup: The Guildflow Guide
## A Book About People, Not Software

After spending more than a 15 years actively participating and helping to organize various technical meetups I am actively trying to give back to this space.

So far the primary result of this effort is [Guildflow](https://guildflow.com), my ever-improving take on meetup software.

However, software is just a tool, and much of a meetup group's success is about people problems and this is a book about those people problems.

## Open Source

This will be an open source book and I am going to make a concerted effort to work in the open. 

Right now I'm taking a first stab at an [outline](OUTLINE.md) and some chapters. I'm uploading my raw chapters as `.draft.md` files and will drop the `.draft` and make a PR once I fee like there is something meaningful for review.

That said, if you have an idea for something this book should cover please make an issue.

## About The Author

My name is **Mike Zornek** and I'm a fellow meetup organizer from Philadelphia, PA.

Meetup groups are a great way to share and give back to your community. Through organizing meetups I have met some incredible peers, many who have become dear friends. I've learned a ton of technical knowledge and experienced countless career opportunities.

After a growing discontent with the meetup tools of the day I started to build out something new called [Guildflow](https://guildflow.com/) that lets group organizers own their data and respected the privacy of group members. I am really excited how it’s starting to take shape.
