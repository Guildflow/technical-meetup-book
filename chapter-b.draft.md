* Should you start a New Meetup Group?
  * Alternative to a New Meetup Group
    * Helping or growing an existing group
    * One-off events
  * Understanding the Time, Effort, Challenges and Benefits involved
  * Do you research
    * Attend other meetups
    * Take notes
    * Figure out what you actually want to build here.


While it's easy to let a new idea kick off a series of work, I think it's important to ask prospect organizers, if a new meetup is really what they should be doing?

Planting a flag and trying to build a new meetup group is a large commitment and it's good to understand some alternative which might be a better first step.

instead of a new group can you help an exsisting meetup group? 

Most cities don't have enough bandwidth for two technical groups covering the same lanugage so if there is already an group highly considering trying to volenteer, improve or otherwise grow that group. Most of these groups are volenteer driven and they are starving for more people to help out. You could even start a special interest group inside of a exsisting group structure, a testing group inside an iOS group as an example. You could also put energy into a new event type like a book club, or a social side project day. The point is, one of the first goals if you started a new group would be to find more leadership and this just shortcircuts the need.

If there is no exsisting group you might also consider a one-time event to help test the waters.

For these kind of events, I would try to keep it goal oriented, like a 4 hour workshop over the weekend to learn a new language or framework. This would help you get some experience under your belt, validate your ideas and make connections that could naturally evolve into a longer term meetup group.

Research

Before you attempt to start a meetup you need to attend some meetups, and the more the better. These meetups need not even be for tech that you have expreince with. The goal is to observe them in detail, take some notes and figure out the experience you want to produce at your own meetup.

* Observe the attendees. 
  * Ask them why they show up, why they present. Learn what modivates them. What are they excitied about in the topic space of the group, or in general. Be authentic when talking to them. Do more listenint than talking.
  * How many people showed up? How old are they? Is this a diverse group?
  * How do they act at the meeting? Do they freely mingle or sit by themselves waiting for the presentation to begin?
  * What do they do after the meeting? Do they go to a bar afterwords? Are there people who might be uncofortable going to a bar or are otherwise underage?
* Observe the organizers. 
  * How do they run the meeting? What do you think works well and what does not? 
  * Was there an agenda? Did they start on time? Did they stick to it?
  * What do you like about the overall style and execution?
* Observe the presenters.
  * Did they use slides? Did these slides have a positve impact on the talk?
  * Did the presentor demo things directly from a laptop? How did that work out? Was a quick transition or clunky? Did they need an adaptor to connect?
  * Was there a projector? How did it work out?
  * Was the talk well done or feel rushed / unpracticed?
  * Did the presenter finish in time? Did they run long? How did the organizer handle this and stick to the agenda?
* Observe the venues. 
  * How easy was it to find? Was there parking or public transit nearby?
  * Was wifi available to the guests? the speakers? How well did it work during any presentations?
  * Was there building secutiyu available?

The other REALLY important thing to do at these meetings is make connections. Share your intent about starting a new group for topic X. Share this with the meetup organizers and the attendees. Lots of groups offer attendees a quick moment to speak to annouce things, take advantage of this.

If you want to be really smart have them write their email on a signup paper/notebook to hear when the first meeting will be. Be sure to contact these people the next day. Tell them it was nice to meet them, repeat your intent to start the new group and thank them for their interest.

Documenting what you want your group to be.

What problems are you solving for people?

The core benifits of a technical meetup group include:

* Education - Helping people learn about and mastering different technologies. Meetup groups empower education through technical presentations and creating enviornments for people to share and get help with their own projects.
* Community - Helping people connect with others who share their interest in a specific technology which over time can help foster more adhoc discussions, opportuites and friendships.
* Career Growth - Helping people who are new to tech find a job in the tech industry or otherwise helping people move up or vertically (to other fields) in the tech industry. Through education some people will also use meetups as a stepping stone to larger tech conference speaking opportunites. Through community many people are alerted to job opportunites they 

Meetups are a long game.

Do not expect overnight success with a meetup group. If you want to start a new group you should commit be commited for at least 9 months if not a full year.

What are the typical commitments?

Time

Per month there are common activies you can expect to do. Most of these are not particularly expensive or challenging, but do take time. The include:

* Planning a meeting
  * finding speakers
    * helping speakers 
  * marketing the meeting via email/twitter/etc

At a high level estimate you can potentially spend time per month, working with speakers, sending out invites, updating websites, writing meeting agendas, attending meetings a little early and late to prepare and cleanup, recording presentations, post meeting notes, publishing recorded media. 
* For a small, early group it's probably 2-5 hours a month, for a larger group maybe 5-10 hours a month. You can also lessen this by growing a group's leadership (more below).
